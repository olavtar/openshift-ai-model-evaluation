# Git Workflow

## Branch Naming

Format: `type/short-description`

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`, `ci`

Examples:
- `feat/user-authentication`
- `fix/login-redirect-loop`
- `refactor/extract-payment-service`
- `docs/architecture`
- `docs/technical-design-phase-1`
- `docs/work-breakdown-phase-1`
- `docs/requirements`

## Commit Messages

This project uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
type(scope): short description

Optional body explaining why, not what.

Optional footer (e.g., BREAKING CHANGE, Closes #123)
Assisted-by: Claude Code
```

- Subject line: imperative mood, lowercase, no period, max 72 characters
- Body: wrap at 80 characters
- One logical change per commit (atomic commits)

### Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `feat` | New feature |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation changes |
| `style` | Formatting, no code change |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests |
| `chore` | Maintenance tasks |

### Scopes

| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `ui` | Frontend package |
| `api` | Backend package |
| `db` | Database package |
| `deploy` | Deployment/Helm |
| `deps` | Dependencies |

### Examples

```bash
# Feature
feat(ui): add dark mode toggle to header

# Bug fix
fix(api): handle null email in user creation

# Breaking change
feat(api)!: change user endpoint response format

BREAKING CHANGE: User responses now include nested profile object

# Multiple scopes
feat(ui,api): add user profile editing
```

### Commitlint

Commit messages are validated by commitlint. Invalid messages will be rejected:

```bash
# Bad - will be rejected
git commit -m "added feature"
git commit -m "Fix bug"

# Good - will pass
git commit -m "feat(ui): add user profile page"
git commit -m "fix(api): handle empty request body"
```

## AI Assistance Trailers

When committing code that was written or substantially shaped by an AI tool, include a trailer in the commit message footer:

- `Assisted-by: <tool name>` — for commits where AI assisted but a human drove the design and logic
- `Generated-by: <tool name>` — for commits where the code is substantially AI-generated

The `prepare-commit-msg` hook in `.claude/hooks/` can automate this for Claude Code commits. See `.claude/rules/ai-compliance.md` for full Red Hat policy details on AI marking requirements.

## Pre-commit Checks

On every commit, Husky runs:

1. **lint-staged**: Format and lint changed files
2. **commitlint**: Validate commit message format

If checks fail, the commit is aborted. Fix issues and retry.

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/add-user-profile
   ```

2. **Make changes and commit**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat(ui): add user profile page"
   ```

3. **Push and create PR**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feat/add-user-profile
   ```

4. **PR Description Template**
   ```markdown
   ## Summary
   - Added user profile page with avatar and bio
   - Connected to /users/:id API endpoint

   ## Test plan
   - [ ] Profile page renders correctly
   - [ ] API errors show error message
   - [ ] Loading state displays skeleton

   ## Screenshots
   [If UI changes, include before/after]
   ```

5. **Review and merge**
   - Get approval from reviewer
   - Squash and merge to main
   - Delete feature branch

## Rules

- Never commit secrets, credentials, API keys, or `.env` files
- Never force-push to `main` or `master`
- Rebase feature branches onto main before merging (prefer linear history)
- Delete feature branches after merge
- Tag releases with semantic versioning (`v1.2.3`)

## Common Git Commands

```bash
# Start new feature
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b feat/my-feature

# Stage and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat(scope): description"

# Push feature branch
git push -u origin feat/my-feature

# Update feature branch with main
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout feat/my-feature
git rebase main

# Undo last commit (keep changes)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Discard all local changes
git checkout -- .
git clean -fd
```

## Semantic Release

The project uses semantic-release for automated versioning:

- `feat` commits -> minor version bump (1.0.0 -> 1.1.0)
- `fix` commits -> patch version bump (1.0.0 -> 1.0.1)
- `BREAKING CHANGE` -> major version bump (1.0.0 -> 2.0.0)

Release is triggered automatically when merging to `main`.
